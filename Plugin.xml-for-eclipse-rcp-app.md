We already know how to [program plugin.xml for eclipse-equinox-app](plugin.xml-for-eclipse-equinox-app). Now we will program "plugin.xml" for eclipse-rcp-app.

Take [rcp application](../tree/master/tutorialExamples/RcpApp-1) that we created in [RCP tutorial](Create-first-RCP-app) as a starting point.
