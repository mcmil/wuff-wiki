Wuff does the following for you:

- downloads and "mavenizes" Eclipse bundles.

- generates runnable Eclipse products for multiple platforms and locales.

- generates OSGi-specific MANIFEST.MF.

- generates plugin.xml.

- generates plugin_customization.ini.

- generates intro pages.

- wraps non-OSGi dependencies into OSGi-bundles.

Every wuff feature is highly automated yet configurable.
