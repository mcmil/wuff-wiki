Wuff does the following for you:
- downloads and "mavenizes" Eclipse bundles.
- generates runnable Equinox/RCP/IDE products for multiple platforms and locales.
- generates and merges OSGi manifests.
- generates and merges plugin.xml.
- generates and merges plugin_customization.ini.
- integrates splash.bmp into RCP/IDE app.
