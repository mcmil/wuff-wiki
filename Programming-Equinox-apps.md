Definition: Equinox application is an OSGi-based Java application, which uses [Equinox Launcher](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Equinox_Launcher) for bootstrap and configuration.

Equinox application does not have to have GUI, although GUI can be started on top of it, like in Eclipse IDE.

In this tutorial we will learn how to create Equinox app from scratch, using Wuff. The resulting Equinox app, when run on console, prints a message to the user.
