There are cases when using OSGi for Java GUI development is a bit of overkill. Imagine, we are developing a simple GUI app, not requiring extension-points, preferences, workspaces etc.etc.

Exactly for such cases Wuff supports non-OSGi SWT apps. In this tutorial we start from scratch and build SWT app.

- [Create first SWT app](Create-first-SWT-app)
- [Configure SWT products](Configure-SWT-products)
- [Prepare SWT app for multiproject build](Prepare-SWT-app-for-multiproject-build)
- [Create SWT library and use it in SWT app](Create-SWT-library-and-use-it-in-SWT-app)
- [Localize SWT app](Localize-SWT-app)
