We already know how to [program plugin.xml for eclipse-bundle](plugin.xml-for-eclipse-bundle). Now we will program "plugin.xml" for eclipse-equinox-app.

Take [equinox application](../tree/master/tutorialExamples/EquinoxApp-1) that we created in [Equinox tutorial](Create-first-Equinox-app) as a starting point.
